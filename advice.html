                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says that mindfulness
                        means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment.

                        "It's easy to stop noticing the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our
                        bodies are feeling and to end up living 'in our heads' â€“ caught up in our thoughts without
                        stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour," he says.

                        "An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our bodies and the sensations they
                        experience. This means waking up to the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the present moment.
                        That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs.

                        "Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they
                        happen moment to moment.

                        "It's about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can
                        positively change the way we see ourselves and our lives."

                    <p> As well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more
                        formal mindfulness practice.

                        Mindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the
                        sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind
                        starts to wander.

                        Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.

                    Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional
                    pressure. It is our body's response to pressure. When we encounter stress, our body produces
                    stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system.
                    Sometimes, this stress response can be useful: it can help us push through fear or pain.
                    However, too much stress can cause negative effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of
                    fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our
                    physical and mental health.

                    Anything that puts high demands on you can be stressful. Stress can also be internal or
                    self-generated but often caused by external factors. Work related stress is an unfortunae symptom of
                    many modern working environments.While some workplace stress is normal, excessive stress can
                    interfere with your productivity and performance, impact your physical and emotional health, and
                    affect your relationships and home life and lead to <a href="#burnout-section">burnout</a>. It can
                    even determine the difference between success and
                    failure on the job. Whatever your ambitions or work demands, there are steps you can take to protect
                    yourself from the damaging effects of stress, improve your job satisfaction, and bolster your
                    well-being in and out of the workplace.

                            Burnout is characterized by the triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a
                            decreased sense of accomplishment in oneâ€™s occupation. Job burnout is a special type of
                            work-related stress â€” a state of physical or emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense
                            of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal identity.
