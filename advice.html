                    <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says that mindfulness
                        means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment. "It's
                        easy to stop noticing
                        the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our bodies are feeling and to end
                        up living 'in our heads' â€“ caught up in our thoughts without stopping to notice how those
                        thoughts are driving our
                        emotions and behaviour," he says. "An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our
                        bodies and the sensations they experience. This means waking up to the sights, sounds, smells
                        and tastes of the present
                        moment. That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs.
                        "Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they
                        happen moment to moment. "It's
                        about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can positively
                        change the way we see ourselves and our lives."

                    <h2>
                        The Basics of Mindfulness
                    </h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p> As well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more
                        formal mindfulness practice.

                        Mindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the
                        sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind
                        starts to wander.

                        Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.
                    </p>
                    <p> If possible, take time each day to be with your family; for example, try arranging a fixed time
                        to eat
                        dinner together, or you could simply arrange a day out with friends you have not seen for a
                        while
                        try switching off the TV to talk or play a game with your children, friends or family
                        have lunch with a colleague.
                        Volunteering at a local school, hospital or community group would be a lovely idea. Find out how
                        to
                        volunteer on the GOV.UK websites
                        make the most of technology to stay in touch with friends and family. Video-chat apps like Skype
                        and
                        FaceTime is helpful, especially if you live far apart.

                    <p>
                        Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure.
                        It is our body's response to pressure. When we encounter stress, our body produces stress
                        hormones that trigger a
                        fight or flight response and activate our immune system. Sometimes, this stress response can be
                        useful: it can help us push through fear or pain. However, too much stress can cause negative
                        effects. It can leave
                        us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term,
                        this can affect our physical and mental health.

                    <p>
                        Anything that puts high demands on you can be stressful. Stress can also be internal or
                        self-generated but often caused by external factors. Work related stress is an unfortunae
                        symptom of many modern working
                        environments.While some workplace stress is normal, excessive stress can interfere with your
                        productivity and performance, impact your physical and emotional health, and affect your
                        relationships and home life
                        and lead to <a href="#burnout-section">burnout</a>. It can even determine the difference between
                        success and failure on the job. Whatever your ambitions or work demands, there are steps you can
                        take to protect
                        yourself from the damaging effects of stress, improve your job satisfaction, and bolster your
                        well-being in and out of the workplace.

                            In 2019, 'burnout' was recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as an 'occupational
                            phenomenon'.
                            As lockdowns have drastically affected our work-life balance and working environments,
                            experts have
                            conducted
                            regular research to ascertain the public's perceptions of burnout and the contributing
                            factors,
                            considering the pandemic.

                        <p>
                            Burnout is a state of physical and emotional exhaustion. It can occur when you experience
                            long-term stress
                            in your job, or when you have worked in a physically or emotionally draining role for a long
                            time.

                            Recognising job burnout is the first step in preventing burnout. Workle allows you to track
                            your mood and provides a visual history of your emotions & feelings of stress. An awareness
                            of negative mood patterns
                            allows he user to anticipate potential burnout and tackle the problem before it grows out of
                            control.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Workle allows the user to cultivate the ability to self-reflect& complete a periodic
                            assessment of their mood. This allows them to attend to their own needs, realign their goals
                            and reevaluate their potentially
                            harmful work, or school, schedules. Of course, basic things such as a balanced diet, regular
                            exercise, getting enough sleep and mainitaing a healthy work life balance are all effective
                            methods of preventing
                            burnout in general.
