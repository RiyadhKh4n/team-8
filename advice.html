          <hr>
          <p>
            Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says that mindfulness
            means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment.

            "It's easy to stop noticing the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our
            bodies are feeling and to end up living 'in our heads' ‚Äì caught up in our thoughts without
            stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour," he says.

            "An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our bodies and the sensations they
            experience. This means waking up to the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the present moment.
            That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs.

            "Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they
            happen moment to moment.

            "It's about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can
            positively change the way we see ourselves and our lives."

          <hr>
          <p> As well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more
            formal mindfulness practice.

            Mindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the
            sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind
            starts to wander.

            Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.
          </p>
          <p> If possible, take time each day to be with your family; for example, try arranging a fixed time to eat
            dinner together, or you could simply arrange a day out with friends you have not seen for a while
            try switching off the TV to talk or play a game with your children, friends or family
            have lunch with a colleague.
            Volunteering at a local school, hospital or community group would be a lovely idea. Find out how to
            volunteer on the GOV.UK websites
            make the most of technology to stay in touch with friends and family. Video-chat apps like Skype and
            FaceTime is helpful, especially if you live far apart.

        <p>
          Most people feel stressed sometimes and some people find stress helpful or even motivating. But if stress is
          affecting your life, there are things you can try that may help.Stress is the body‚Äôs physical response to a
          real or perceived threat, demand, or danger.

          When you feel threatened, your body releases stress hormones which prepare the body to respond. This is called
          the ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response.

        <p>
          Sometimes a pressurised situation triggers a stress response. The situation may not actually put you in
          danger. But your body may react as if it does.

          A stress response can be helpful in some situations. It can increase your performance. But sometimes it can be
          detrimental to your mental health.

          Recognising the different types of stress ‚Äî and how your body responds to them ‚Äî can help you get help with
          stress when you need it.

          There are three main types of stress. These are acute, episodic acute, and chronic stress. We explore each
          type of stress below:

              Stress can cause many different symptoms. It might affect how you feel physically, mentally and also how
              you
              behave.
              It's not always easy to recognise when stress is the reason you're feeling or acting differently.
