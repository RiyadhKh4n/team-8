# Workle

[Link to Live Site Here]()

The purpose of Workle is to allow users to track their day to day emotions and for them to visually see how they feel over a period of time. It is a tool which users can use to help track and manage stress ....

Workle is a site where users can go in order to track their emotions on a daily basis. Everyday users are able to chose a colour which represents their overall emotion/feeling for the day (e.g. Green = Happy / Red = Angry) and add a comment describing how their day was and any potential reasons for feeling this way.

By entering how they feel every day users are able to visually see a grid displaying all prior days and how they felt. Over time this grid will build out and be a visual represntation of the users day to day emotions helping them to monitor stress levels and overall mantal wellbeing. 

Workle also has a page dedicated to explaining and helping users understand different feelings (e.g. anxiety, depression and stress) and provides useful resources which they can use to help deal with them. 

And example of how the grid will look after serveral uses can be seen below:
