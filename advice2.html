          | What is Mindfulness?
        hr
        p
          | Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says that mindfulness
          | means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment.
          | &quot;It&apos;s easy to stop noticing the world around us. It&apos;s also easy to lose touch with the way our
          | bodies are feeling and to end up living &apos;in our heads&apos; &ndash; caught up in our thoughts without
          | stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour,&quot; he says.
          | &quot;An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our bodies and the sensations they
          | experience. This means waking up to the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the present moment.
          | That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs.
          | &quot;Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they
          | happen moment to moment.
          | &quot;It&apos;s about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can
          | positively change the way we see ourselves and our lives.&quot;

        p
          | As well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more
          | formal mindfulness practice.
          | Mindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the
          | sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind
          | starts to wander.
          | Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.

          | What is stress?
        hr
        p
          | Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional
          | pressure. It is our body&apos;s response to pressure. When we encounter stress, our body produces
          | stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system.
          | Sometimes, this stress response can be useful: it can help us push through fear or pain.
          | However, too much stress can cause negative effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of
          | fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our
          | physical and mental health.

        p
          | Anything that puts high demands on you can be stressful. Stress can also be internal or
          | self-generated but often caused by external factors. Work related stress is an unfortunae symptom of
          | many modern working environments.While some workplace stress is normal, excessive stress can
          | interfere with your productivity and performance, impact your physical and emotional health, and
          | affect your relationships and home life and lead to 
          a(href='#burnout-section') burnout
          | . It can
          |                     even determine the difference between success and
          |                     failure on the job. Whatever your ambitions or work demands, there are steps you can take to protect
          |                     yourself from the damaging effects of stress, improve your job satisfaction, and bolster your
          |                     well-being in and out of the workplace.
