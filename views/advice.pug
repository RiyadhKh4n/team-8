              | Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says that mindfulness
              | means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment. &quot;It&apos;s
              | easy to stop noticing
              | the world around us. It&apos;s also easy to lose touch with the way our bodies are feeling and to end
              | up living &apos;in our heads&apos; &ndash; caught up in our thoughts without stopping to notice how those
              | thoughts are driving our
              | emotions and behaviour,&quot; he says. &quot;An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our
              | bodies and the sensations they experience. This means waking up to the sights, sounds, smells
              | and tastes of the present
              | moment. That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs.
              | &quot;Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they
              | happen moment to moment. &quot;It&apos;s
              | about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can positively
              | change the way we see ourselves and our lives.&quot;

              | As well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more
              | formal mindfulness practice.
              | Mindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the
              | sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind
              | starts to wander.
              | Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.
            p
              | If possible, take time each day to be with your family; for example, try arranging a fixed time
              | to eat
              | dinner together, or you could simply arrange a day out with friends you have not seen for a
              | while
              | try switching off the TV to talk or play a game with your children, friends or family
              | have lunch with a colleague.
              | Volunteering at a local school, hospital or community group would be a lovely idea. Find out how
              | to
              | volunteer on the GOV.UK websites
              | make the most of technology to stay in touch with friends and family. Video-chat apps like Skype
              | and
              | FaceTime is helpful, especially if you live far apart.

              | Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure.
              | It is our body&apos;s response to pressure. When we encounter stress, our body produces stress
              | hormones that trigger a
              | fight or flight response and activate our immune system. Sometimes, this stress response can be
              | useful: it can help us push through fear or pain. However, too much stress can cause negative
              | effects. It can leave
              | us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term,
              | this can affect our physical and mental health.

              | Anything that puts high demands on you can be stressful. Stress can also be internal or
              | self-generated but often caused by external factors. Work related stress is an unfortunae
              | symptom of many modern working
              | environments.While some workplace stress is normal, excessive stress can interfere with your
              | productivity and performance, impact your physical and emotional health, and affect your
              | relationships and home life
              | and lead to 
              a(href='#burnout-section') burnout
              | . It can even determine the difference between success and failure on the job. Whatever your ambitions or work demands, there are steps you can take to protect yourself from the damaging effects of stress, improve your job satisfaction, and bolster yourwell-being in and out of the workplace.
